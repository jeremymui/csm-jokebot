# CSM Jokebot

A jokebot that reads jokes with a prompt and punchline from CSV files or Reddit’s /r/dadjokes.

#### Example:

> Why don't they play poker in the jungle? (prompt)

###

> There’s too many cheetahs! (punchline)  

The end result should be a Python program that we can run that keeps telling us these jokes until we tell it to quit, or it runs out of jokes.

## Usage
- To read jokes from the CSV file `jokes.csv`, run `python jokebot.py jokes.csv`

- To download jokes from Reddit, run `python jokebot.py`.
